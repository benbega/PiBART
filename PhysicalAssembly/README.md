## Printing The Train Assembly

The .STL files in this folder make up the full physical assembly of the train. The only structural part that needs to be purchased are the ball bearings that the axles are fed through. All parts are affixed using standard super glue.

All components were printed in PLA, with a layer height of .24mm and a wall count of 3, with a gyroid infill structure at 10% total infill. These values can likely be changed according to your needs, as no parts undergo serious structural stress.

The current version of the train uses V2 of the motor gear, and requires a belt to transfer power from the motor to the axle. If you want to run the system without a belt, you can use v1 of the motor gear, but this may require a motor with more torque.

## Printing the track assembly

All track components can be snapped together and friction fit if printed without any warping. All settings can remain the same as the train assembly. The main rails come in two pieces in order to add more strength to the overall structure. To add more strength, the main rail pieces can be offset to go between two rail holders, letting you move the track around without taking it apart, if needed.

All structures have only been tested with the components listed in the parts list file. Modifications to the 3D models may have to be made if you want to switch components.

## Purchased Components

1. Rubber Sealed Bearings with 1/4" inner diameter and 5/8" outer diameter. Bearing width is 9/32".

This list will be amended if any other structural components are purchased for the train.
